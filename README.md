# Tux on Pixels

Pixel Art icon theme for Linux.

### Inspiration

I was inspired to make this linux icon theme based on this [android icon theme](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pixbit.prime&hl=en_US).

### Things needed to make pixel art icons

- Any pixel art editor
- 16x16 pixel canvas
- [Resurrect 32 color pallete](https://lospec.com/palette-list/resurrect-32)
- Inkscape (to vectorize the icons)
